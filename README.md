# DTH
Codes for implementing and replicating all simulations in "DTH:  nonparametric test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions"

1. The folder DHT_simluations contains all simulation codes and results used in the paper.
2. The folder DHT contains the following:
   i) DHT.R - R code for standalone function that can be used to implement DHT.
   ii) DHT_markdown.pdf - A short vignette that shows how to implement the function DHT.R
   iii) sparrows.csv, Tikus.Rdata - Example data that was used in the vignette.



Please reach out to me at asmita112358@gmail.com or aroy38@jh.edu if you have any questions about implemting the code.
